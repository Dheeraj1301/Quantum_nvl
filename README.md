## q_routing
### MODULE: q_routing

#### 1. Overview
QuantumFlow_AI provides a dedicated routing component for distributing token traffic among numerous experts in very large model architectures. The `q_routing` module implements classical and quantum-driven techniques to compute efficient assignments from input tokens to experts. NVIDIA-scale deployments, where thousands of GPU workers operate across GB200 or DGX systems, require robust traffic shaping to ensure uniform load and minimal network congestion. The module is built with a minimal API so external orchestration code can pass JSON or CSV descriptions of token queues along with structural information about available experts.

The module accepts token streams as either JSON lists or Pandas DataFrames. Each token descriptor typically includes a unique identifier, associated metadata, and potential hints about computational complexity. The routing layer also takes a `model_graph` file describing how many experts exist and optionally how they are connected. From these inputs, the module generates a mapping assigning each token to a specific expert. Results are returned as a JSON-compatible Python dictionary so the planner or scheduler can apply them directly to workload orchestration. Optional logging outputs record the selected routing parameters for later analysis.

#### 2. Optimization Options and Effects
Numerous toggles allow engineers to tune the behavior of `q_routing` for their cluster. Classical routing draws on lightweight heuristics, whereas quantum options rely on the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to optimize token placement. Toggle selections include enabling QAOA, adjusting the number of QAOA layers, applying the Hybrid Quantum Classical (HQC) setting, and enabling deterministic fallback routines. When QAOA and HQC are both activated, the module first attempts quantum optimization; if the quantum execution fails or the quantum hardware queue is overloaded, the fallback ensures progress with deterministic heuristics.

Enabling only QAOA causes the algorithm to directly optimize an Ising-model representation of the traffic. The cost function penalizes load imbalance and network contention. With a small number of layers the system converges quickly but may leave some congestion unsolved. Increasing the layer count adds circuit depth, capturing more complex interference patterns, but at the cost of additional quantum runtime. The HQC mode instructs the optimizer to warm start from classical predictions. When toggled with QAOA, the classical router generates an initial configuration that seeds parameter selection inside the quantum circuit. This reduces the number of iterations required for convergence in practice.

When the deterministic path is selected without QAOA, the routing module builds an assignment purely from hashing each token onto an expert index. Although simpler, this approach ensures progress on hardware platforms lacking a quantum accelerator. The combination of all toggles (QAOA + HQC + deterministic fallback) yields a robust configuration that automatically exploits quantum acceleration when available while never blocking due to missing hardware.

#### 3. Internal Algorithmic & Mathematical Logic
At the core of the module lies an Ising model that captures pairwise conflicts between tokens competing for the same expert. The Hamiltonian is formulated as

\[ H(\mathbf{z}) = \sum_{(i,j)} J_{ij} z_i z_j + \sum_i h_i z_i, \]

where \( z_i \) denotes whether token \( i \) is assigned to a particular expert, and the couplings \( J_{ij} \) encode congestion penalties. During QAOA execution the circuit starts with a layer of Hadamard gates to create superposition across candidate assignments. Alternating parameterized mixers and cost operators then shape the amplitudes according to the angles \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \). The module uses two layers by default, leading to a parameter vector of size \( 2 \times 2 \times N \), where \( N \) is the number of qubits mapped to experts.

With HQC enabled, a classical router first computes a token-to-expert mapping using heuristics such as consistent hashing and locality-aware balancing. The resulting plan is encoded into a vector of angles to warm start QAOA. Each warm-start angle is the weighted sum of the classical assignment and a small perturbation to encourage exploration. Subsequent iterations of gradient descent, implemented with PennyLaneâ€™s optimizer, refine the angles. Convergence criteria rely on the difference in expectation values of the Hamiltonian between iterations. Once the cost function improvement falls below a threshold the algorithm terminates. Tokens are then assigned based on the probabilities derived from the final quantum state by sampling the most likely configuration.

Internally the module stores routing decisions as adjacency lists. Each token record is appended to an expert queue described by the expert index. This internal representation is serialized for downstream components expecting JSON. In cases where quantum execution is not possible the `simulator.py` component supplies a drop-in interface that mimics QAOA call signatures. Engineers can toggle this explicitly to test the classical fallback path.

#### 4. Industrial Relevance
NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 systems combine multiple NVSwitch-enabled GPU nodes, requiring careful coordination of token distribution for large mixture-of-experts models. The `q_routing` module offers an extensible approach: the QAOA path attempts to minimize cross-node traffic by solving the routing problem in a unified quantum framework, while the deterministic fallback ensures consistent throughput when hardware resources are constrained. Because the module exposes its results as JSON, a cluster scheduler can directly integrate it with Kubernetes or Slurm deployments.

In large language model pipelines, token routing influences overall latency and GPU utilization. Effective routing reduces time each GPU spends waiting for data from remote peers. Production clusters may maintain dozens of NVLink-connected GPUs per node; the quantum algorithm ensures tokens that heavily interact remain colocated, reducing NVLink traffic. This leads to measurable latency improvements and provides consistent performance as models scale beyond hundreds of billions of parameters.

#### 5. Recommendation Table
Below is a guideline for selecting routing settings. Input size reflects the number of tokens or batch size, and optimization goal indicates whether throughput, stability, or energy use is prioritized.

## q_energy
### MODULE: q_energy

#### 1. Overview
The `q_energy` module controls how workload energy is scheduled across GPU clusters and optional quantum accelerators. It ingests historical telemetry captured in CSV logs or streaming JSON from monitoring tools, alongside configuration files describing cluster topology. From these inputs, the scheduler generates predicted power draw per node and chooses an energy plan that balances GPU clocks, NVLink bandwidth, and quantum accelerator activity. Outputs are stored as JSON objects summarizing recommended frequency caps, active accelerator counts, and predicted energy savings. These outputs feed the global orchestration layer responsible for spinning up or scaling down resources.

#### 2. Optimization Options and Effects
The energy optimizer exposes toggles for QAOA-based dependency scheduling, classical GNN prediction, and a hybrid meta-learning mode. When QAOA scheduling is on, the scheduler formulates the energy routing problem as a dependency graph and uses a parameterized quantum circuit to minimize peak demand. Classical-only mode runs a GNN predictor that estimates energy consumption patterns and uses heuristics to distribute workloads. In hybrid mode, the meta-learning controller chooses between quantum and classical submodules by consulting a policy network that observes real-time metrics.

Combining QAOA with the classical GNN yields a layered approach: first the GNN produces a coarse allocation, then the quantum solver refines the placement of tasks to reduce worst-case energy spikes. Enabling meta-learning along with both core optimizers activates reinforcement learning for configuration adaptation. As the system sees new workloads, it learns to assign certain job categories to either quantum or classical pipelines based on predicted efficiency. Disabling all toggles reverts to a simple scheduler that treats each node independently.

#### 3. Internal Algorithmic & Mathematical Logic
The QAOA dependency scheduler models energy constraints using an Ising Hamiltonian:
\[ H(z) = \sum_i \alpha_i z_i + \sum_{i<j} \beta_{ij} z_i z_j, \]
where \( \alpha_i \) captures estimated power usage per task and \( \beta_{ij} \) increases when tasks share dependencies that force concurrency. Optimization uses two alternating layers with additional rotation gates on ancilla qubits to encode multi-level power states.

The classical GNN predictor embeds task graphs into node features representing compute cost and communication load. A GraphSAGE network outputs predicted energy curves, which drive a greedy heuristic selecting the minimal set of GPU nodes needed to meet service-level targets. The meta-learning module keeps an LSTM that tracks prediction error over time and chooses whether to rely on the GNN or the QAOA scheduler for the next scheduling window.

#### 4. Industrial Relevance
Managing power draw is critical for large GPU clusters running trillion-parameter models. GB200 NVL72 systems must stay within power budgets while maximizing throughput. The `q_energy` module enables energy-aware scheduling so multiple pipelines can share the same hardware. By accurately predicting energy impact, engineers can allocate NVLink bandwidth and GPU clocks more effectively. When paired with other modules, `q_energy` can route tasks to quantum accelerators only when beneficial, preserving energy for classical workloads that scale linearly.

## q_compressor
### MODULE: q_compressor

#### 1. Overview
The `q_compressor` module implements data compression routines with optional quantum autoencoders. Inputs consist of raw tensors representing model weights, gradient shards, or feature activations. These tensors may be streamed in from file uploads, NumPy arrays, or parsed from binary checkpoints. The compressor outputs smaller tensor blocks along with metadata describing quantization and pruning operations. Downstream systems can send the compressed representations to storage or network endpoints, significantly reducing bandwidth needs when synchronizing multi-node models.

#### 2. Optimization Options and Effects
Operators can enable or disable three primary optimizations: a variational quantum circuit (VQC) autoencoder, a classical denoising model, and a dropout-based simulator that measures compression fidelity under stochastically pruned channels. Turning on the VQC path allows the module to train a small quantum circuit that learns to represent high-variance components of the tensor in a compact latent space. Enabling the denoiser uses a shallow convolutional network to remove quantization artifacts before the final packing step. The dropout simulator can be toggled to run Monte Carlo studies that identify channels least sensitive to noise.

Combining VQC with the denoiser often yields the best compression rate for structured weight matrices. The dropout path can be used with or without the VQC. When paired, dropout results help determine which qubits should remain active in the quantum circuit. The module will automatically lower the number of wires in the circuit if dropout consistently identifies qubits with minimal influence. If only dropout is enabled, the compressor acts primarily as a classical tensor pruning tool with no quantum cost.

#### 3. Internal Algorithmic & Mathematical Logic
The VQC autoencoder is built from strongly entangling layers parameterized by a weight tensor. When encoding an input vector \( x \), the circuit produces a latent representation \( f(x; \theta) \). Training minimizes
\[ L(\theta) = \sum_i \| x_i - f^{-1}(f(x_i; \theta); \theta) \|^2, \]
where \( f^{-1} \) represents the decoding portion of the circuit. Gradients are computed using the parameter-shift rule. The optional dropout simulator randomly zeroes subsets of qubits after each entangling layer, modeling decoherence. The classical denoiser is a residual network trained on a dataset of compressed-decompressed pairs.

During inference, the compressor selects the trained VQC path if available. It encodes incoming tensors, prunes qubits below a variance threshold, and writes the remaining latent values along with the index of retained qubits. If the classical path is chosen, the module quantizes tensors using uniform 8-bit encoding and optionally runs the denoiser before packing. Metadata describing the operation chain is recorded in a side file so the decompressor can reconstruct the original layout.

#### 4. Industrial Relevance
In trillion-parameter LLM deployments, model state synchronization is a major bandwidth consumer. NVLink and NVSwitch fabrics allow high throughput but still benefit from reduced transfer volume. The `q_compressor` module significantly cuts traffic when checkpoints or gradient updates must be shared across nodes. When integrated with GB200 systems, the quantum autoencoder offloads a portion of the compression to dedicated quantum accelerators, freeing GPU cycles for training. Even without quantum hardware, the classical code paths provide solid space savings.

#### 5. Recommendation Table
| Scenario | Toggle Set | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Weight checkpoint archiving | VQC + Denoiser | Highest ratio, more training time |
| Real-time gradient sync | Dropout only | Fast but moderate compression |
| Mixed precision inference | VQC + Dropout | Good space savings with stable quality |
| CPU-only environment | Denoiser only | Lightweight, purely classical |

## q_decompressor
### MODULE: q_decompressor

#### 1. Overview
The `q_decompressor` module restores tensors that were compressed by the companion compressor. It accepts compressed binary blocks, along with metadata describing the compression steps, and outputs reconstructed NumPy arrays. Data may arrive as uploaded files, from a message queue, or via direct memory buffers. The decompressor supports optional quantum solvers for reconstruction tasks such as matrix inversion through HHL, spectral refinement via QSVT, and frequency decoding with QFT. Each of these techniques can be toggled individually.

#### 2. Optimization Options and Effects
Key toggles include enabling the HHL solver, the QSVT spectral refiner, or a classical LSTM enhancer. When HHL is on, the module attempts to solve linear systems arising from autoencoder inversion using a simulated or hardware quantum subroutine. The QSVT option improves accuracy by refining eigenvalue estimates of the decompressed matrix. The LSTM enhancer is a classical module that learns typical reconstruction residuals and corrects them. Combining HHL and QSVT generally yields the most faithful decompression at the expense of runtime. Adding the LSTM enhancer helps smooth numerical noise when quantum hardware is limited.

Disabling all toggles results in a straightforward classical decompression path that simply reverses the quantization and pruning steps recorded in the metadata. The module will automatically fall back to this path whenever the quantum library is unavailable or the incoming data indicates a purely classical compression procedure.

#### 3. Internal Algorithmic & Mathematical Logic
The HHL solver uses a small quantum circuit to compute the inverse of matrix \( A \) such that \( A x = b \). The algorithm decomposes \( A \) via phase estimation and applies rotations conditioned on eigenvalues to produce a solution vector. In practice the module runs a simplified simulation that approximates the result with few qubits for speed. The QSVT refiner treats the decompressed tensor as an operator and applies a sequence of polynomial transformations to sharpen eigenvalue estimates.

When the LSTM enhancer is enabled, the decompressed tensor is fed through a recurrent network trained on residual errors from previous decompression tasks. This network predicts correction values that are added to the output. The resulting tensor more closely matches the original data before compression.

#### 4. Industrial Relevance
Large-scale training pipelines may store intermediate activations or optimizer states using the compressor. The decompressor ensures those states are accurately reconstructed when jobs resume or when distributed checkpoints need to be merged. For NVL72 deployments, minimizing reconstruction error is vital because small discrepancies can produce diverging gradients. By providing quantum-assisted accuracy improvements, the module helps keep massive models synchronized even when data is heavily compressed.

#### 5. Recommendation Table
| Input Type | Recommended Toggles | Notes |
|------------|--------------------|------|
| Sparse activations | HHL + QSVT | Best accuracy for ill-conditioned systems |
| Dense weight matrices | LSTM enhancer | Handles subtle patterns missed by pure quantum decoders |
| Quantized embeddings | None | Basic decompression is sufficient |
| High-noise data | QSVT + LSTM | Mitigates reconstruction errors |

## q_hpo
### MODULE: q_hpo

#### 1. Overview
Hyperparameter optimization for extremely large models can require thousands of trial runs, making it impractical to perform purely by grid search. The `q_hpo` module provides a suite of classical, quantum, and hybrid optimization techniques that search configuration spaces far more efficiently. Inputs to the module include JSON or YAML files describing hyperparameter ranges, prior experiment metrics in CSV form, and optional warm-start models. Outputs consist of recommended hyperparameter sets as well as a history of evaluated points.

#### 2. Optimization Options and Effects
Available toggles include a variational quantum circuit (VQC) optimizer, a classical Gaussian-process-based surrogate, and a hybrid strategy that alternates between them. Enabling the VQC optimizer alone instructs the system to encode hyperparameters as qubit rotations and search for minima using a parameterized circuit. The classical surrogate approach fits a Gaussian process to observed losses and performs Bayesian optimization. Hybrid mode leverages the VQC for early exploration of promising regions, then refines results with the surrogate model.

Warm-start toggles allow the user to supply previous trial results. When enabled alongside the surrogate model, the system trains the GP on past data before exploring new configurations. Combining warm-starts with the VQC optimizer seeds the circuit parameters using encodings of the best historical runs, improving convergence speed.

#### 3. Internal Algorithmic & Mathematical Logic
The VQC optimizer represents each hyperparameter using amplitude encoding. For a learning rate \( \eta \) within bounds \( [a, b] \), the circuit prepares a qubit angle \( \theta = \pi (\eta - a)/(b-a) \). The cost function is constructed as an expectation value from a small Hamiltonian built to reflect validation loss. Gradient descent is performed with parameter-shift, and the optimizer selects the parameter set corresponding to the lowest measured loss after a fixed number of shots. The surrogate model builds a kernel matrix using the RBF kernel
\[ k(x, x') = \exp\Big( -\frac{\|x-x'\|^2}{2 \ell^2} \Big), \]
where \( \ell \) is tuned during training. Predictions guide the selection of new hyperparameters by maximizing the expected improvement acquisition function.

#### 4. Industrial Relevance
With trillion-parameter models, each training run can cost thousands of GPU hours. Efficient hyperparameter search is therefore critical. The `q_hpo` module reduces the number of experiments needed to reach strong performance, saving compute resources on GB200 NVL72 clusters. By supporting hybrid quantum-classical optimization, it gives practitioners flexibility when quantum hardware is only intermittently available. Results produced by `q_hpo` can be fed directly into training pipelines managed by orchestration systems such as MLFlow or internal scheduling services.

#### 5. Recommendation Table
| Goal | Hardware | Recommended Toggles | Trade-offs |
|------|----------|--------------------|-----------|
| Rapid exploration | Quantum device | VQC optimizer | Best for wide search spaces |
| Fine-grained tuning | Classical only | Surrogate model + warm-start | Lower variance but slower exploration |
| Intermittent access | Partial quantum | Hybrid mode | Balances exploration and cost |
| Reuse old studies | Any | Warm-start enabled | Leverages prior work |

## q_nvlink
### MODULE: q_nvlink

#### 1. Overview
The `q_nvlink` module focuses on optimizing data flows across NVLink and NVSwitch topologies for large-scale GPU clusters. It expects graph descriptions of the hardware fabric in NetworkX JSON format, capturing GPU nodes, NVLink edges, and bandwidth constraints. Users may also supply job profiles describing expected communication intensity between nodes. The module outputs routing plans and scheduling directives used by the cluster manager to assign tasks to GPUs while minimizing cross-switch traffic.

#### 2. Optimization Options and Effects
Toggle options include a QAOA-based graph optimizer, a classical topology classifier, and a reinforcement-learning planner. Enabling the QAOA optimizer runs a quantum circuit that colors the NVLink graph to reduce congestion. The classical classifier predicts which topology patterns will lead to contention and suggests alternative layouts. The reinforcement-learning planner monitors real-time throughput metrics and adjusts routing decisions accordingly. Using the QAOA optimizer alongside the RL planner yields proactive congestion avoidance with continual feedback. The classifier alone is best suited for static deployments where the graph rarely changes.

#### 3. Internal Algorithmic & Mathematical Logic
The QAOA optimizer formulates NVLink assignment as a graph coloring problem. Nodes correspond to GPUs, edges represent NVLink connections, and colors reflect communication groups. The cost Hamiltonian penalizes edges connecting same-colored nodes. A circuit with depth equal to the number of allowed colors iteratively updates angles to minimize collisions. The reinforcement-learning planner treats each node as an agent with a policy determining message routing. Rewards are proportional to achieved bandwidth divided by latency. The classical classifier uses a support vector machine trained on historical cluster logs to recognize problematic patterns.

#### 4. Industrial Relevance
On GB200 NVL72 systems, NVLink provides the high-bandwidth backbone between GPUs. Efficient scheduling of messages across this fabric is crucial when training enormous models that produce large gradient tensors. By incorporating quantum search, `q_nvlink` can find edge colorings that reduce simultaneous traffic on the same links. When integrated with the RL planner, the module adapts to dynamic job arrivals and avoids congestion during heavy workloads. This translates to better GPU utilization and lower time-to-solution for production LLM jobs.

#### 5. Recommendation Table
| Cluster Size | Recommended Toggles | Notes |
|--------------|--------------------|------|
| Fewer than 8 GPUs | Classifier only | Minimal overhead |
| 8-32 GPUs | QAOA optimizer | Good balance of search and runtime |
| 32+ GPUs | QAOA + RL planner | Necessary for dynamic heavy loads |
| Static training cluster | Classifier + RL | Learns stable patterns |

## q_attention
### MODULE: q_attention

#### 1. Overview
`q_attention` augments transformer layers with quantum-inspired primitives that accelerate attention calculations. The module can accept token embeddings as NumPy arrays or tensors exported from frameworks like PyTorch. It outputs updated embeddings after applying advanced attention kernels. The module supports quantum kernel attention, parameter-efficient pruners, and hybrid transformer layers.

#### 2. Optimization Options and Effects
Available toggles include QAOA-based sparse attention, a quantum position encoder using phase estimation (QPE), a classical contrastive trainer, and a Q-SVD head pruner. Enabling QAOA sparse attention selects top-k query-key pairs using quantum sampling. QPE adds position encodings via quantum phase estimation. The contrastive trainer refines the attention mechanism with classical optimization, while the Q-SVD pruner reduces the number of heads by evaluating singular values. Using QAOA alongside QPE results in lower memory consumption but requires access to a quantum simulator or hardware. Combining the classical trainer with the pruner works well on CPU-only setups.

#### 3. Internal Algorithmic & Mathematical Logic
QAOA sparse attention computes relevance scores between query and key vectors. The pairwise dot product matrix forms a cost Hamiltonian. A short-depth circuit samples indices with high relevance, effectively selecting the top-k pairs without computing the full matrix. The QPE position encoder encodes sequence index \( i \) as a phase rotation \( e^{2\pi i / N} \) on dedicated qubits. The classical contrastive trainer computes a loss of the form
\[ L = \sum_{i} -\log \frac{\exp(q_i \cdot k_i)}{\sum_j \exp(q_i \cdot k_j)}, \]
and updates layer weights using stochastic gradient descent. The Q-SVD pruner performs singular value decomposition on each attention head matrix and removes heads with leading singular values below a chosen threshold.

#### 4. Industrial Relevance
Reducing the compute cost of attention layers is essential for trillion-parameter LLMs. NVL72-scale clusters often struggle with the memory footprint of dense attention. `q_attention` provides drop-in alternatives that preserve model quality while decreasing memory traffic. Hybrid layers that split computation between quantum accelerators and GPUs allow selective offload of the most expensive operations. When paired with q_nvlink and q_routing, the attention module contributes to a pipeline that keeps GPU utilization high even for extremely long sequences.

#### 5. Recommendation Table
